# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes project completion by KmattFPS. 

Self Refection: 
# Learned how to use lists properly
# Learned images, and links.
# Learned how to be sane, and manage my time. 
# Had fun, it was easy as I've worked with HTML before. 
# Learned a lot about writing commit messages, and using git.
